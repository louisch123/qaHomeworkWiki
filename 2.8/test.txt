The @ChicagoBears have rushed for at least 225 yards in each of their last 4 games.

The last team to accomplish that was the 1976 Steelers.

The two plays on the outside are huge penalties but the one in the middle is not. 

If you’re gonna make these calls you HAVE TO make them consistently. #DaBears #Bears #Chcaho

So, I presume the NFL will issue the Bears and apology for a completely blown call on an obvious pass interference? That after handing Miami every cheesy call all afternoon?
