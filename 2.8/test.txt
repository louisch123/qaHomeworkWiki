The @ChicagoBears have rushed for at least 225 yards in each of their last 4 games.

The last team to accomplish that was the 1976 Steelers.

So, I presume the NFL will issue the Bears and apology for a completely blown call on an obvious pass interference? That after handing Miami every cheesy call all afternoon?

I won’t pretend that I even remotely thought Justin Fields would break out this year.

Congrats to those that made that call. 💪🏻

Justin Fields’ development is what matters the rest of this season, not wins and losses. He’s been electric recently, and the once-embarrassing Bears offense has averaged 31.3 points in the last 3 games #Bears

Miami #Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa, after today's victory against the Chicago Bears, is now 12-2 in his last 14 starts and 13-1 in the last 14 games he has finished. 

Elite.
